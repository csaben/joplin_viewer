# Joplin Viewer


A sample project for using python and react together as backend and frontend, respectively. Uses docker to containerize the frontend and backend.


Notes:

* Joplin itself running on the local machine will fail to work with containerized backend unless connected via docker network ( in progress)
* Frontend dependencies work but need review
* On linux docker-compose needs to be downloaded separate from docker (at least Ubuntu)
